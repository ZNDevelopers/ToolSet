Welcome to ToolSet!
Here is a bit of a tutorial on how to use the config files for ToolSet.

Each config file uses a language called Yaml (Yaml Ain't Markup Language). You can see how to use it at http://yaml.org/.

Each command has a setting called 'enabled'. Setting this to TRUE (`enabled: true`) turns on the command. Setting this
 to FALSE (`enabled: false`) will not start up (or disable if already running) the command.

Most commands will also have a 'messages' setting. This has 3 different types of messages (player, broadcast and
 console). Each message uses Minecraft colors, set with the '&' symbol (e.g. black is &0). The player message section
 is the message that gets sent to the player when that message gets used. The broadcast message gets sent to everyone
 BUT the player, and the console message gets sent to the server console.

Commands can also have special options, which have help inside that command's main options section.

Each command has a separate file, with its specific settings inside. Removing a key from this file will set it back to
 its default value. Deleting this file will re-create it with default values on reloading the plugin.
