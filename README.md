Want to help us out with ToolSet?

The main thing you can do is make plugins. They are what actually does stuff
and are the most important part of everything. There is some help on plugins in
the wiki.

If you don't want to make plugins, of course you can work on ToolSet too. Just
fork the repo, create whatever you want and submit a pull request. Policy
coming soon.

Wiki
----

There is a wiki if you need some help in ToolSet, just click the Wiki button on
the toolbar. It contains a bunch of information about creating ToolSet modules.
If you want to learn how to use ToolSet, it also [will soon] have info about
doing that too.
